                            All throughout your life you may have heard the term "follow through;" on your homework, on
                            a job, or on a promise. Well this phrase is especially important in dog training. Dogs are
                            just like we were as children. I have a teen and a toddler, so can be very relatable. If we
                            ask our dog to sit, he doesn't, and we just give up or give him a treat anyway, we set a
                            standard for our training. Our dog will soon learn that he doesnt have to sit and he may
                            even get rewarded without doing anything. When we continue that command to it's conclusion,
                            your dog will quickly learn that he must execute the action to get his reward.
