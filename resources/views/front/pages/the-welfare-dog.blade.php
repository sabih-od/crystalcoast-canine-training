                            If you have ever heard the term "Welfare Dog," you have also probably heard the terms "hand
                            feeding" or "not giving the food away free." As we train our dogs, it is important to find
                            something they will work for; a toy, food, or good old-fashioned praise. It is common for
                            household dogs past the puppy phase (and some still in the puppy phase) to lose interest in
                            working for food. Many people will comment about their dog not having that food drive; but
                            in reality, the dog has received "free" food for so long that there is no reason to work for
                            it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In these cases, we have to reintroduce the desire to follow the food. Food luring is a
                            popular way to teach new commands and even tricks, because the dog follows the food with his
                            nose. We must remove the idea of being on welfare and create a job for them, whether he's
                            providing a service or just being a well-behaved pup. By removing the bowl your dog eats
                            from and replacing it with your hand, he is realizing it comes from YOU. We can ask him to
                            sit, down, heel, fetch, etc in return for food. If no effort is given by the dog, then no
                            food is received.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If we want our dogs to work, we must also be willing to work and create a job for them.
