                    <p>
                        We all know we are supposed to protect our dogs from illness and disease. We spend hundreds
                        if not thousands per year on health tests, spay/neuter, flea/ tick/various worm
                        preventatives, and even countless dollars on collars, leashes, and sometimes clothing.

                    <p>
                        If you have ever heard the term "Welfare Dog," you have also probably heard the terms "hand
                        feeding" or "not giving the food away free." As we train our dogs, it is important to find
                        something they will work for; a toy, food, or good old-fashioned praise.

                    <p>
                        All throughout your life you may have heard the term "follow through;" on your homework, on
                        a job, or on a promise. Well this phrase is especially important in dog training. Dogs are
                        just like we were as children. I have a teen and a toddler, so can be very relatable.

                Service dogs can be wonderful companions for people with disabilities. The right service dog will
                help you live independently and lift your spirits. However, it is understandable that you might feel
                some anxiety about adopting a service dog, particularly if you are a first-time pet owner. By
                understanding some of the benefits and responsibilities you will receive along with your service
                dog, you will get a clear picture of what life might be like after welcoming your new pet into the
                household. Hereâ€™s some info to get you started, courtesy of Crystal Coast Canines.
