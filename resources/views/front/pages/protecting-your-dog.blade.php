                            We all know we are supposed to protect our dogs from illness and disease. We spend hundreds
                            if not thousands per year on health tests, spay/neuter, flea/ tick/various worm
                            preventatives, and even countless dollars on collars, leashes, and sometimes clothing.

                            Anxiety, stress, and fear can create health issues too. They can cause your dog to get
                            ulcers, hotspots, and even cause excessive biting and itching at paws and tails. Who's
                            guilty of letting everyone who asks pet your dog? Or dragging your dog through a doorway
                            just to get inside? What about letting other dogs invade their space at the dog park? These
                            actions can cause immense levels of anxiety and if you don't attack these issues right away
                            they can create a fearful and potentially aggressive dog.

                            By understanding our pups needs and comfort levels it allows us to know how far we can push
                            them and know in what areas they need improvement. We all want a pup that can go anywhere
                            and thrive in any environment, but we have to expose them in the right increments.

                            Strangers petting your dog-
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I personally do not let many people pet my personal dogs and dogs that I am training. I want
                            my dogs to be social with people and be able to say hello, but if they say hello to
                            everyone, it can create a high desire to be pet every time we go in public. Now my dogs are
                            working line, so that behavior is unacceptable. On the other end of the spectrum, if a dog
                            is uncomfortable around strangers and many are allowed to pet them, it can create immediate
                            behavior such as barking, nipping, pulling away, or trembling. To avoid this, I usually will
                            let people know that my dog is anxious and is not okay to be pet, or simply say "no" he or
                            she is training.

                            Fear of walking through doorways-
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Some dogs that have not been out and about much may show signs of fear toward doorways,
                            strange objects, and crowds in public, specifically automatic doors and cash registers. It
                            is important to ease your dogs nerves by allowing them to enter at their own pace. I don't
                            expect you to stand there all day and wait, but using treats or a toy to lure him or her
                            through the area and not rushing is a good place to start. It is best practice to start out
                            in a less populated store like Tractor Supply or Lowes (Garden entrance) on an weekday when
                            there aren't many people or dogs out.

                            Socialization with other dogs-
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Socializing your pup with other dogs can be tough if your dog is reactive or becomes anxious
                            around others. If you are meeting a new dog for the first time, it can be extremely
                            beneficial to have your dog go on a walk with him or her. Have the other owner and dog
                            accompany you and your pup on a nice quiet walk on a trail or calm road. This gives the dogs
                            an opportunity to familiarize themselves before being nose to nose or off leash in a yard or
                            field. Once they are comfortable with each other, you can proceed to a closer introduction.

                            When we protect our dogs from potentially dangerous and stressful situations we can prevent
                            long lasting effects, so exposing your dog to different environments, sounds, and situations
                            in small increments will help create a more confident and well rounded dog. If you have
                            difficulty with any of this and are uncomfortable doing it on your own, it is wise to see
                            professional help.
